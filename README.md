# The Pattern Archipelago

A collection of geometrical patterns to learn logic. A little island to explore when you are starting your journey in DSA or programming in general.

### The Prologue

When I started learning patterns, they felt all over the place—chaotic and overwhelming.

Whether I practiced on websites or solved assignment questions, they were just problem statements where the logic explanations felt isolated and stacked. I couldn't see the big picture. 

So, I sat down and drew those patterns. I connected the dots and realized I had to start from the **Quadrants** (the right-angled triangles) to make sense of the rest. 

As I visualized the grid in my notebook, it occurred to me that documenting this systematic approach of how all these patterns have a*skeletal* part (the geometry) and the *body* part (the data) would benefit other novice programmers as well. 

**A Note to the Reader:** I recommend you to try to solve these yourself first, then check this book as a reference. Trust me, the sense of accomplishment when you finally get the logic correct and output right is *priceless*. 
### How to use this book

This repository is structured as a course, not a random list. It is designed to take you from "drawing lines" to "painting with logic."

**Phase I: Know The Grid (The Geometry)**
We ignore the numbers and focus entirely on the loops.
* **The Primary:** Learning the coordinate system ($i, j$) using squares and triangles.
* **The Derived:** How to glue simple shapes together to form Pyramids and Diamonds.
* *Goal:* To be able to look at any shape and mentally break it down into $i$ and $j$ loops.

**Phase II: Rook, Camel, and Horse (The Data)**
Once the shape is steady, we change what we print inside it.
* **The Rook (Straight Lines):** Row or Column based values (1, 2, 3...).
* **The Camel (Diagonals):** Logic that changes along the diagonal ($i == j$).
* **The Horse (Jumps):** Boolean logic (Evens, Odds, and alternators).

**Phase III: The Endgame (Complex Logic)**
The final test. Here we combine geometry and data to create alphabets, hollow patterns, and dynamic shapes.
